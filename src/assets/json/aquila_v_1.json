Unlike other genres of Jewish liturgical poetry,  piyyut directly involved the congregation in their performance. The main body of the  poem was performed by a cantor, often with the congregation chanted a refrain. As a part of the liturgy,  piyyut  were not just poems but also a form of prayer and  a means of commenting on the Torah readings. They were often highly dramatic,  bringing the biblical texts to life for the congregation. The  piyyut  had an  important religious role for the medieval Jewish congregation: through their  performance, the members of the congregation developed their spiritual  relationship to God through understanding the Torah, and strengthened their  sense of being part of a community through the shared experience of communal  prayer. Piyyut  were evidently important to the medieval Jewish community: over 40% of  the texts in the Genizah are poetry."
